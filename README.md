# Adhesion-segmentation-algorithm
In order to solve the problem of accurate segmentation in the adhesion state such as peanut, which has the characteristics of non-convex shape, complex surface texture and diverse structure, a new adhesion segmentation algorithm integrating 3D spatial information and 2D image processing technology is proposed. Firstly, the peanut 3D point cloud model was reconstructed using the linear structured light system, and then the peanut 3D model was segmented, and then the edge contour of a single peanut was extracted, and the peanut template was created based on the peanut contour for feature-based matching and segmentation of the adhered peanut images.
